# CSV-Web-Spider
Created a python spider to crawl websites and check whether it matched a criteria from a list of urls on a .csv file

I was working on checking if companies in a company mailing list were part of the aerospace/defense industries, for marketing purposes. I wrote this script as a little utility for myself to automate the process.  It was an interesting little experiment and served my purposes, but if I were to make it an office wide utility I would implement a GUI and inputs for the filename, search terms, and output options.  I probably would also work on a way to stop the search if it found a match.  For my own work purposes though it did what I wanted it to do.
